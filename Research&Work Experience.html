<h2> PhD Research Topic</h2>
<body>
<b>Machine Learning for Software Quality Assurance, Aug 2019 - Present</b>: <br>
Build machine learning models on software systems to help developers automatically improve software quality assurance, especially change-level software defect prediction. 
Mine software systems, generate new datasets, propose new data balancing methods, build models and create new effort-aware evaluation criteria.
<ul>
  <li>Extracted high dimension features form software defect prediction projects with <b>deep learning</b>.</li>
  <li>Built deep Neural network <b>time serious incremental models</b> using <b>LSTM</b> to detect software change defects.</li>
  <li>Designed self-auto learned models using <b>deep reinforcement Learning(DQN)</b> on software engineering with Pytorch.</li>
  <li>Created a new class balancing method to preserve data distribution with <b>Principal Curve (PC)</b>.</li>
  <li>Researched the uncertainty in Software Vulnerability.</li>
  <li>Mined software systems and projects to uncover relationships of software system.</li>
  <li>Generated new just-in-time software defect prediction datasets on public open-source projects.</li>
</ul>
<h2> RFCUNY Research Experience</h2>
<b>Protocol and Data Analysis, Apr 2022 - Jul 2023</b>: <br>
Create protocols to collect data from various internet-of-thing(IoT) devices, network and cloud; Develop data parser to collect information from files. Analysis data; Visualize data and present data.
<ul>
  <li>Investigated web scraping techniques to extract research data from websites.</li>
  <li>Made protocols for data collection via network and Bluetooth.</li>
  <li>Developed a Bluetooth low energy parser.</li>
</ul>
<b>Software Engineer, Sep 2020 - Jan 2021</b>: <br>
Host Intrusion Detection System(HIDS):Developed a software with C++ for SC-based HIDS which extracts features from the network packets, then feed to neural network.
